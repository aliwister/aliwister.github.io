I am a fourth-year **Ph.D.** student in [IST](https://ist.psu.edu) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/).  

I also received my **M.S.** and **B.S. (Honors)** in [Computer Science](https://eecs.psu.edu) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/). 

My research interests include:  
**Graph Learning**, **LLM RAG Methdologies**, **LLM/VLM RAG Security**, **Geospatial Reasoning**.  

Please reach out to aha112 at psu dot edu for research collaboration.
